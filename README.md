🎮 Game Design Document – Overview
Core Vision

A futuristic open-world RPG shooter set in a cyberpunk-inspired city. The game emphasizes fast-paced combat, deep character builds, and meaningful loot progression. Players rise from the slums to confront corporate elites by acquiring weapons, armor, cybernetics, and accessories—each with unique attributes, rarity tiers, and upgrade paths.

✦ Core Features
Character & Progression

Single protagonist with flexible build paths.

Skill trees presented as animated cards, giving unlocks tangible, collectible feel.

Cybernetics (3 slots): augmentations offering passive buffs or active abilities.

Accessories (3 slots): grenades, drones, traps, or utility items for combat flexibility.

Armor system: head, chest, legs, boots → enables tank, DPS, stealth, or support playstyles.


Combat

High-mobility FPS → sprint, dash, crouch, wall-slides (via skills/cybernetics).

Physics-driven projectiles → dynamic gunplay (TABG-inspired).

Weapon modding system → 3 slots per weapon; mods interchangeable.

Accessories → tactical depth (deployables, grenades, drones, hacking tools).

Damage feedback → floating numbers:

White = normal

Red = crit



Loot & Inventory

Rarity tiers: Common → Rare → Epic → Legendary → Iconic.

Weapons/armor score system: upgradable with Tier Components (e.g., Tier 3 Upgrade Component).

Iconics: unique drops from bosses; randomized variants.

Ammo system: pooled by type, auto-pickup until full.


Inventory design:

Weapons → 2 primaries + 1 sidearm/melee.

Armor → armor slots only.

Cybernetics + accessories → dedicated slots.

Backpack → ammo, mods, consumables, misc.


World & Districts

Industrial Docks → warehouses, small combat spaces.

Central Market/Slums → trade, gangs,  narrow alleys.

Corporate District → skyscrapers, corpo HQs, higher level.

Additional planned districts (expandable):

Outskirts/Wastelands (gang hideouts, server farms).

Seamless mission integration: contracts, vendors, and encounters flow naturally.

Vendors → upgrades, stash access, black-market trades.


Multiplayer

Optional co-op → friends join host’s world session.

Enemy scaling & loot scaling tied to host’s level.


Visual & UI Polish

Inventory UI: semi-transparent dark grey overlay; game remains visible.

Player movement allowed while open (no combat).

Equip feedback: particle effects (glitch burst, energy pulse, holo-scan).

Style: vibrant, fast, avoids static/asset-flip look.
