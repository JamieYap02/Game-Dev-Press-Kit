Game Design Document
Overview

A futuristic open-world RPG shooter set in a cyberpunk-inspired city. The game emphasizes fast-paced combat, deep character builds, and meaningful loot progression. Players grow their reputation and strength by acquiring weapons, armor, cybernetics, and accessories—each with unique attributes and upgrade paths.

Core Features
Character & Progression

Single protagonist with flexible build paths.

Skill trees designed as animated cards, making unlocks feel tangible and unique.

Cybernetics (3 slots): augmentations that provide passive buffs or active abilities.

Accessories (3 slots): grenades, drones, traps, or utility items for combat flexibility.

Armor system (head, chest, legs, boots) to reinforce builds (tank, damage, stealth, support).

Combat

High-mobility FPS combat: sprint, dash, crouch, wall-slides (depending on skills/cybernetics).

Physics-driven projectiles for gunplay that feels dynamic.

Weapon modding system: 3 slots per weapon, with any combination of mods attachable.

Accessories provide tactical depth (grenades, deployables, drones).

Damage feedback: floating numbers (white = normal, red = crits, color-coded by element/damage type).

Loot & Inventory

Rarity tiers: Common → Rare → Epic → Legendary → Iconic.

Weapons/armor have score-based ratings, with upgrades available via vendors using Tier Components (e.g., Tier 3 Upgrade Component).

Iconic loot: tied to bosses via the Nemesis system (post-launch). Each has unique randomized variants.

Ammo: shared per type, auto-picked up unless stack is full.

Inventory system:

Weapons only in weapon slots (2 primaries + sidearm/melee).

Armor only in armor slots.

Cybernetics + accessories in dedicated slots.

Backpack limited to ammo, mods, consumables, and misc.

Stash system: players can store any item (weapons, armor, etc.) in properties or access stashes at specific vendors.

World

Districts:

Industrial Docks: warehouses, smuggling hubs, gritty combat spaces.

Central Market/Slums: busy trade, narrow alleys, black market missions.

Corporate District: sleek skyscrapers, corporate HQs, restricted zones.

Seamless mission integration: objectives emerge naturally from the environment (contracts, vendors, contacts).

Vendors: upgrade, stash, and trade systems.

Multiplayer

Optional cooperative play: friends can join your open-world session.

Loot drops & enemies scale to the host player’s level.

Trading system planned for future updates.

Visual & UI Polish

Inventory UI allows player movement while open (but no combat).

Equip feedback: small particle effects (glitch burst, energy pulse, holographic scan) to make equipping items feel satisfying.

Stylized aesthetic: fast, vibrant, and playful with cyberpunk undertones, avoiding static asset-flip look.
